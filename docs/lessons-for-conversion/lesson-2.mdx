## Lesson for Conversion: Faith in Jesus
### Jesus: The Savior of the World

Many believe that JESUS CAN SAVE, but many do not know what kind of Savior He is.

### HE IS THE SUFFICIENT SAVIOR
John 8:36 - So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed. You or another person cannot do anything to add to the saving work of Christ. No need for additional yoke such religious requirements, observance of sacraments, traditions, etc.

### HE IS THE ONLY SAVIOR: Exclusive
Acts 4:12 - Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved. “Because Jesus is sufficient, God did not provide other “saviors” but made Him to be the only savior for all mankind.

### HE IS THE DIVINE SAVIOR
To be a savior, you must be God! Jesus cannot be the Savior if He is not God.
Jesus is both God and Savior!
Titus 2:13 - while we wait for the blessed hope-- the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ,
Jesus is the true God and eternal life!
1 Jn 5:20 - We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true-- even in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.

### HE IS THE ABLE SAVIOR
Jesus is able to save the worst of sinners.. even whom man considers impossible.
1 Tim 1:15 - Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners-- of whom I am the worst.
Matt 19:25-26 - When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, "Who then can be saved?" Jesus looked at them and said, "With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible."

### HE IS THE PERMANENT SAVIOR
Because Christ is God, He ever lives to make intercession for us. Thus, He has a permanent priesthood. He has not given His work as mediator to anyone.
Heb 7:23-24 - Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.

### HE IS AN ACCESSIBLE SAVIOR – JOHN 6:37; 3:17
Christ is readily available to all kinds of people! You can go directly to Him.
John 3:17 - For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.
John 6:37 - All that the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away.

### CHALLENGE: JESUS IS THE ENTIRE SAVIOR YOU NEED. JESUS MUST BE YOUR SAVIOR, OR YOU HAVE NO SAVIOR AT ALL! BELIEVE; TRUST IN HIM NOW AS YOUR SAVIOR! HE IS READY AND ABLE TO COMPLETELY SAVE YOU!
