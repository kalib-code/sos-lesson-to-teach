# WHY WE NEED A SAVIOR

## Introduction

In order to accept the "good news" of salvation, people must first realize their sin and see their need for a Savior.

## FELLOWSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MAN IN THE BEGINNING

a. GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS IMAGE - means man has the spirit part, that which as able
to communicate with God. (Genesis 1:27)

b. GOD WOULD VISIT MAN IN EDEN - `Then the man and his wife heard the sound of the
LORD God as he was walking in the garden in the cool of the day’ (Genesis 2:8)

## FELLOWSHIP BROKEN WHEN MAN SINNED AGAINST GOD

God provided for all the needs of man. But he also gave them command not to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. (Gen 2:16) But Adam and Eve disobeyed & sinned against God. When God visited them in the Garden, they were ashamed and tried to hide themselves from God. (Gen 3:8b). Then God drove them out of the Garden of Eden. The fellowship was broken.

## THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST SIN ON THE HUMAN RACE

What came into the heart of Adam & Eve after they sinned?

a. GUILT - being aware they have violated God & His law, they hid from God

b. FEAR - – because they God rightly have something against them.

c. DEATH - Sin brought death! Rom.6:23. Death as a result of sin means:
State of separation: man’s spirit became dead towards God, even if he is physically alive - `you were dead in your transgressions and sins’ .Eph 2:1 Eternal separation from God (Who is God) –` ***it is appointed for men to die once, but after this the judgment. Heb 9:27. `He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the
gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power.’ 2 Th 1:8-9***

d. CONDEMNATION - `under God’s wrath’ – already condemned. Whoever believes in him is
not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not
believed in the name of God's one and only Son. John 3:18

## RESULTS OF THAT FIRST SIN UPON US PERSONALLY

a. WE ARE BORN WITH A SINFUL NATURE - `All of us also lived among them at one time,
gratifying the cravings of our sinful nature and following its desires and thoughts. Like the rest, we were by nature objects of wrath - Ephesians 2:3`

b. WE ARE GUILTY - Because of our sinful nature, we sin, and so we are guilty and deserving punishment.

c. WE ARE BOUND - under the control of sin. I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature. For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, the evil I do not want to do-- this I keep on doing (Romans 7:18-19)

## THE CONCLUSION

WE ARE IN DANGER – WE NEED TO BE SAVED
WE CANNOT SAVE OURSELVES – WE NEED A SAVIOR.
