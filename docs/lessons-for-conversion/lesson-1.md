# WHY WE NEED A SAVIOR

## Introduction

In order to accept the "good news" of salvation, people must first realize their sin and see their need for a Savior.

## FELLOWSHIP BETWEEN GOD AND MAN IN THE BEGINNING

a. GOD CREATED MAN IN HIS IMAGE - This means that man has the spirit part, which is able to communicate with God. (Genesis 1:27)

b. GOD WOULD VISIT MAN IN EDEN - Adam and Eve experienced fellowship with God in the Garden of Eden, where God would walk and commune with them. (Genesis 2:8)

## FELLOWSHIP BROKEN WHEN MAN SINNED AGAINST GOD

God provided for all the needs of man but also gave them a command not to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. However, Adam and Eve disobeyed and sinned against God. When God visited them in the Garden, they were ashamed and tried to hide from Him. As a consequence, God drove them out of the Garden of Eden, and the fellowship between God and man was broken.

## THE RESULTS OF THE FIRST SIN ON THE HUMAN RACE

The first sin committed by Adam and Eve had several profound effects on humanity:

a. GUILT - Adam and Eve became aware that they had violated God and His law, leading them to hide from God.

b. FEAR - They experienced fear because they rightly understood that God had something against them.

c. DEATH - Sin brought about death. Romans 6:23 states that the wages of sin is death. Death, as a result of sin, has two aspects:

- State of separation: Man's spirit became dead towards God, even though physically alive. Ephesians 2:1 describes this as being "dead in your transgressions and sins."

- Eternal separation from God: Hebrews 9:27 states that it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment. Those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of Jesus Christ will be punished with everlasting destruction and be separated from the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:8-9)

d. CONDEMNATION - Humanity stands condemned because of sin. John 3:18 emphasizes that whoever does not believe in the name of God's Son is already condemned.

## RESULTS OF THAT FIRST SIN UPON US PERSONALLY

a. WE ARE BORN WITH A SINFUL NATURE - All of us are born with a sinful nature, and we live according to its desires and thoughts. Ephesians 2:3 states that we are by nature objects of wrath.

b. WE ARE GUILTY - Due to our sinful nature, we sin and thus carry guilt, deserving punishment.

c. WE ARE BOUND - We are under the control of sin. Romans 7:18-19 describes the struggle between the desire to do good and the inability to carry it out.

## THE CONCLUSION

WE ARE IN DANGER - We are in a perilous situation due to sin.

WE CANNOT SAVE OURSELVES - We are incapable of saving ourselves from the consequences of sin.

Therefore, we need a Savior. We need Jesus to save us.

Let Jesus save you today.
