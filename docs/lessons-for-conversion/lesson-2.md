# JESUS: THE SAVIOR OF THE WORLD

Many people believe that Jesus can save, but it is important to understand what kind of Savior He is.

HE IS THE SUFFICIENT SAVIOR

John 8:36 - "So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." Jesus' saving work is sufficient on its own. There is no need for additional requirements, religious observances, sacraments, or traditions. You or anyone else cannot add anything to the saving work of Christ.

HE IS THE ONLY SAVIOR: Exclusive

Acts 4:12 - "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved." Jesus is the only Savior provided by God for all of humanity. He is the exclusive means of salvation.

HE IS THE DIVINE SAVIOR

To be a Savior, one must be God. Jesus cannot be the Savior if He is not God. However, Jesus is both God and Savior.

Titus 2:13 - "while we wait for the blessed hope—the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ."

Jesus is the true God and eternal life.

1 John 5:20 - "We know also that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true. And we are in him who is true by being in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life."

HE IS THE ABLE SAVIOR

Jesus is able to save even the worst of sinners, even those whom humanity considers impossible to save.

1 Timothy 1:15 - "Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners—of whom I am the worst."

Matthew 19:25-26 - "When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished and asked, 'Who then can be saved?' Jesus looked at them and said, 'With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.'"

HE IS THE PERMANENT SAVIOR

Because Christ is God, He lives eternally to intercede for us. He has a permanent priesthood, and He has not delegated His work as a mediator to anyone else.

Hebrews 7:23-24 - "Now there have been many of those priests, since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood."

HE IS AN ACCESSIBLE SAVIOR – JOHN 6:37; 3:17

Jesus is readily available to all kinds of people. You can approach Him directly.

John 3:17 - "For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him."

John 6:37 - "All those the Father gives me will come to me, and whoever comes to me I will never drive away."

CHALLENGE: JESUS IS THE COMPLETE SAVIOR YOU NEED. JESUS MUST BE YOUR SAVIOR, OR YOU HAVE NO SAVIOR AT ALL! BELIEVE IN HIM, TRUST IN HIM NOW AS YOUR SAVIOR! HE IS READY AND ABLE TO SAVE YOU COMPLETELY!
