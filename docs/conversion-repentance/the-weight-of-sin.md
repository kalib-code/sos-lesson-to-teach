# THE WEIGHT OF SIN

Because of the increasing wickedness in the last days, people often underestimate the seriousness of sin. This hinders them from repenting and seeking God's mercy and forgiveness. It is crucial for individuals to recognize the weight and gravity of sin, as evidenced by the fact that sin caused the Son of God to die on the cross. The burden of mankind's sin was laid upon Jesus.

1. ALL SIN IS MORTAL

In the eyes of God, every kind of sin is the same. Religious classifications of sin can sometimes lead to a lack of remorse or regret. However, all sin brings death to the soul and deserves punishment.

Romans 6:23 - "For the wages of sin is death!"

1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - "Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God."

2. ALL MEN ARE GUILTY

In the eyes of God, all people, regardless of their social status or background, are equally sinful. We are all sinners, and God is righteous while we are in the wrong.

Romans 3:10 - "As it is written: 'There is no one righteous, not even one.'"

Romans 3:23 - "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."

1 John 1:8 - "If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."

3. ALL MUST FACE PUNISHMENT

Each individual is guilty and will be held accountable for their actions before God. There is no favoritism in God's judgment.

Romans 2:11 - "For God does not show favoritism."

Ezekiel 18:20 - "The one who sins is the one who will die. The child will not share the guilt of the parent, nor will the parent share the guilt of the child."

4. ALL PUNISHMENT FOR MAN'S SIN WAS BORNE BY JESUS

Because every person is guilty, no one can save themselves or receive help from another human being. Only the sinless one, Jesus, the Son of God, can save. He willingly bore the weight of all mankind's sin and punishment. 

Hebrews 2:9 - "But we do see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone."

CHALLENGE:

Although all sin is deserving of death, the good news is that all sin can be forgiven. Christ has already paid the punishment for our sins. He is our substitute who died in our place. You do not have to bear the punishment of sin yourself.

1 John 5:10-13 - "Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life."
