# REPENTANCE

To truly repent, people need to understand what repentance is and what it is not. Here are some key points to consider:

### WHAT REPENTANCE IS NOT

1. NOT JUST CONVICTION: Repentance is not just feeling guilty or convicted about one's sins. While conviction is a starting point, it should lead to genuine repentance and a change in behavior.

2. NOT JUST SORROW FOR SIN: Mere sorrow or regret for one's sins, especially when caught or facing consequences, is not true repentance. Worldly sorrow does not produce genuine repentance leading to salvation.

3. NOT JUST REFORMATION: Simply trying to be a good person or reforming one's behavior is not enough. True repentance involves acknowledging the need for God's help and recognizing that our own efforts fall short.

4. NOT BECOMING RELIGIOUS: Merely resorting to good religious works or rituals does not constitute true repentance. It requires a genuine change of heart and a turning away from sin.

### WHAT REPENTANCE IS

1. TOWARDS GOD: True repentance involves being sorry to God for one's sins and turning back to Him. It requires acknowledging and confessing our transgressions before Him.

2. TOWARDS SIN: Repentance includes admitting and acknowledging our sins as sins, not trying to justify or cover them up. It also entails hating sin and making a conscious decision to quit and renounce it.

3. TOWARDS SELF: Repentance involves turning from self-centered living and instead living for God. It requires a shift from selfishness to selflessness and a surrendering of our lives to God's will.

### CHALLENGE

God demands true repentance and offers forgiveness to those who genuinely repent. It is important to understand the seriousness of sin and the need for repentance. God is ready to forgive, but we must first repent and turn to Him.

## LESSON TO HELP THE NEW BELIEVER: BEING SURE

As a new believer, it is important to have assurance of your salvation. Satan often tries to attack new believers with doubt. Here are some key points to help you be sure of your salvation:

1. GOD CANNOT LIE: Trust in the truthfulness of God's Word. God's promises are reliable, and He cannot lie.

2. BELIEVE GOD'S TESTIMONY: Choose to believe God's testimony about His Son, Jesus Christ. Reject doubts and accusations that may cause you to doubt your salvation.

3. THREE SOURCES OF ASSURANCE: Find assurance in God's Word, the presence of Christ in your life, and the witness of the Holy Spirit within you.

4. HAVE THE RIGHT FOUNDATION FOR YOUR FAITH: Rely on the facts presented in God's Word rather than your feelings. Trust in the truth of Jesus as the Son of God and the assurance of eternal life through Him.

## CHALLENGE:
Whom will you believe? Choose to trust in the unfailing Word of God, who declares your salvation. Verbalize your assurance in prayer and thanksgiving for your salvation.
