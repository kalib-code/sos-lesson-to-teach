# Lesson for Conversion: Repentance

## REPENTANCE
People need to understand what repentance is so that they can truly repent.

### WHAT REPENTANCE IS NOT
1. **NOT JUST CONVICTION** - feeling guilty.
   - Repentance begins with conviction through the work of the of the Holy Spirit *"And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment (John 16:8). But not all who 'feels guilty' but they don’t stop doing the things they were convicted of. Example - Felix in Acts 24:24 – 25.*

2. **NOT JUST SORROW FOR SIN** – being sorry for your sin.
   - This is sorrow that comes only when caught, or when suffering a consequence of sin. But there is no hatred for the sin enough to quit it. This is called worldly sorrow.
   - 2 Corinthians 7:10 - For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.

3. **NOT JUST REFORMATION** - trying to be a good person.
   - Many try in their own effort to become a better person. But self-effort has a root of self-righteousness that does not acknowledge the need for God's help. Hence, the person has no real need to repent.
   - Isaiah 64:6 - All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags.

4. **NOT BECOMING RELIGIOUS** - resorting to good, religious works.
   - The Pharisees were extremely religious, but Jesus demanded from them proof of true repentance.
   - Matthew 3:7-8 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them: "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? Produce fruit in keeping with repentance.

### WHAT REPENTANCE IS
1. **TOWARDS GOD**
   a. **BEING SORRY TO GOD FOR YOUR SIN** - True repentance is sorrow towards God. 
      - *Have mercy on me, O God, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge - Psalms 51:1,4*
   b. **TURNING TO GOD** - *This is what the Lord Almighty says: 'Return to me,' declares the Lord Almighty, 'and I will return to you,' says the Lord Almighty - Zechariah 1:3*

2. **TOWARDS SIN**
   a. **ADMITTING SIN AS SIN** - (Psalms 32:5) *Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, "I will confess my transgressions to the Lord" - and you forgave the guilt of my sin.*
   b. **HATING SIN** - (Ezekiel 20:43) *there you will remember your conduct and all the actions by which you have defiled yourselves, and you will loathe yourselves for all the evil you have done.*
   c. **QUITTING & RENOUNCING SIN** - (Proverbs 28:13) *He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy. Also, Romans 6:13.*

3. **TOWARDS SELF** - turning from self and living for God.
   - 2 Corinthians 5:15 - *And he died for all that those who live should no longer live for himself but for him who died for them and was raised again.*

### CHALLENGE
God is ready to forgive, but first, He demands true repentance
   - *Acts 17:30* - In the past God overlooked such ignorance, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent.
