# Lessons For Conversion: Repentance

## WHAT IS SIN
The Bible says unless we repent, we will all likewise perish (Luke 13:3). But people cannot repent unless they see sin in themselves.

### SIN IS BREAKING GOD'S LAW
1 John 3:4 Everyone who sins breaks the law; in fact, sin is lawlessness.
1. **Sin is doing acts contrary to God's commands**; like murder, rape, stealing, lying, coveting (Refer to Ten Commandments). This is a sin of commission.
2. **God is the Lawgiver!** He alone sets the standard by which man are measured. One sinful act makes you guilty of all the crimes in all the Law, because you sin, not against the items of the Law but against the Law Giver.
   - James 2:10 - For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
   - Psalms 51:4 - Against you, you only, have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge.

### SIN IS NOT DOING THE GOOD THING WE SHOULD DO
James 4:17 - Anyone, then, who knows the good he ought to do and doesn't do it, sins.
We may not be guilty of telling lies, but are we spreading God's truth? We may not be guilty of stealing, but are we giving to the needy? This is called the `sin of omission`.

### SIN IS FALLING SHORT OF GOD'S GLORY
By man’s measurement of goodness, we may feel somewhat good but by God’s standards no man is good enough.
   - Romans 3:23 - all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.
   - Isaiah 64:6 - All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away.

### SIN IS LIVING FOR SELF RATHER THAN GOD
Sin is going our “own way”, having a wrong purpose, living under a wrong master “SELF”.
   - Isaiah 53:6 - We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

### SIN IS NOT LOVING GOD WITH OUR ALL
In answer to the question, which is the greatest commandment, Jesus replied in Mark 12:28-31 - Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' If this is the greatest and most important commandment, then disobeying it is the greatest sin.

### SIN IS REJECTING JESUS. JOHN 3:36
The greatest mistake: Rejecting Jesus who is the only remedy for sin God offers.
   - Acts 4:12 - Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved.”
   - 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9 - He will punish those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the majesty of his power.
   - John 3:36 - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him.

### CHALLENGE
Seeing your real condition opens the door for your salvation through repentance. Don’t stay long under condemnation. Repent and accept God’s forgiveness.
