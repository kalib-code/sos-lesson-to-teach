# BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

## INCLUDED IN THE LAST WORDS OF JESUS

Read Luke 24:46-49; Acts 1:4,5,8.

Before He went up to heaven, Christ's Last Words to His disciples were:
- Go and preach the gospel to all nations; and
- Wait until you are endued with power from on High.

## CALLED THE PROMISE OF THE FATHER

**Acts 1:4** On one occasion, while he was eating with them, he gave them this command: "Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the gift my Father promised, which you have heard me speak about.

## IT IS POWER FOR WITNESSING

**Acts 1:8** But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."

## INITIALLY EVIDENCED BY SPEAKING IN TONGUES

Speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Spirit given to the believer as a prayer language - through this prayer language, the Holy Spirit helps us in our weaknesses and enables us to pray according to the will of God.

**Rom 8:26-27** In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans that words cannot express. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints in accordance with God's will.

## HOW TO RECEIVE THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

1. **Ask For It** - It is a gift promised by God

   **Luke 11:13** – “...how much more will your Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!”

2. **Receive It By Faith** - Begin to praise God as you received it.

   > "Then they worshipped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy. And they stayed continually at the temple, praising God." (Luke 24:52-53)

3. **Begin to speak in tongues** – it is you, not the Holy Spirit who speaks in other tongues, as the Holy Spirit enables you.

   - **Acts 2:4** All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit enabled them.
   - **Acts 19:6** When Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.

## IT IS FOR ALL BELIEVERS

- **Acts 2:4** All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit...
- **Acts 2:38** Peter replied, "Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit."

## CHALLENGE:
If it is for all believers, it is also for you!
