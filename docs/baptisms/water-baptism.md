# WATER BAPTISM

Water baptism is an important step of obedience for those who believe in Jesus Christ. It symbolizes what has happened to a believer in their union with Christ.

## The Command to be Baptized

Jesus commanded His followers to make disciples of all nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:18-19).

## Demonstrates What Happened to a Believer

Water baptism symbolizes the believer's identification with Jesus Christ:

1. **He Died... I Died with Him**
   - Romans 6:6-7 - Our old self was crucified with Christ so that the body of sin would be done away with.
2. **He Was Buried... I Was Buried with Him**
   - Romans 6:3-4 - We were baptized into Christ's death and buried with Him through baptism.
3. **He Was Raised... I Have a New Life in Him**
   - Romans 6:4-5 - Just as Christ was raised from the dead, we too may live a new life in Him.
4. **He Ascended... I Ascended in Him**
   - Ephesians 2:6 - God raised us up with Christ and seated us with Him in the heavenly realms.

## Meaning of Water Baptism

1. **Picture of a Funeral or Burial Service**
   - Water baptism signifies leaving behind and burying our past sinful life. Baptism alone does not put to death our old life; repentance and faith in Christ accomplish that. Baptism serves as a public declaration of what has already taken place internally.
2. **Picture of Being Planted**
   - Baptism marks the beginning of a new life. It signifies a commitment to a journey of growth and development, moving away from a self-centered and sin-centered life towards a God-centered life. It represents our determination to follow Christ for the rest of our lives.

## When Should a Believer Submit to Water Baptism?

Believers should be baptized as soon as possible after confessing Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior. In the New Testament church, baptism was often an immediate response to faith.

## Challenge: Obeying Jesus' Commands

If we truly love Jesus, we will obey His commands, including the command to be baptized. Water baptism is an act of obedience and a public declaration of our faith in Him.

Let us embrace the opportunity to be baptized in water and demonstrate our love and obedience to our Lord Jesus Christ.
