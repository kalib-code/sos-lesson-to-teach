## YOU ARE READY TO GROW

Congratulations on your decision to accept Christ as your Savior! This decision has resulted in significant changes in your life. Here are some important points to consider as you embark on your journey of growth:

1. YOU ARE A CHILD OF GOD: Through your faith in Christ, you have become a child of God. You now have a personal relationship with Him.
   - Romans 8:15-16: "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, 'Abba! Father!' The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God."

2. YOU ARE A NEW CREATION: The moment you accepted Christ, you were transformed into a new creation. Your old self has passed away, and a new life has begun.
   - 2 Corinthians 5:17: "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come."

3. YOU HAVE A NEW LIFE: Your spiritual rebirth has given you a fresh start and a new life in Christ.
   - Ephesians 2:1-5: "And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked... But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christâ€”by grace you have been saved."

GROWTH IS EVIDENCE OF NEW LIFE:

Having received a new life in Christ, it is essential to nurture and grow in your faith. Here are some important aspects to consider:

1. GROW IN YOUR NEW LIFE: Just as newborn babies crave pure milk for their growth, you should have a desire for spiritual nourishment to grow in your salvation.
   - 1 Peter 2:2: "Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation."

2. GROW INTO CHRISTLIKENESS: The ultimate goal of your growth is to become more like Christ. God works in your life to conform you to the image of His Son.
   - Romans 8:28-29: "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose. For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers."

3. GOD IS EAGER FOR YOUR MATURITY: Our Heavenly Father eagerly looks forward to your growth and maturity in Christ. He is faithful and will continue the work He has started in you.
   - Philippians 1:6: "And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ."

4. GOD PROVIDES FOR YOUR GROWTH: God has equipped you with everything you need for life and godliness through the knowledge of Him. Rely on His divine power as you seek to grow.
   - 2 Peter 1:3: "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence."

PERSONAL DISCIPLINES FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH:

To facilitate your growth, there are certain disciplines you can incorporate into your life:

1. STUDY AND MEDITATION OF GOD'S WORD: The Bible is your spiritual food. Make it a priority to study and meditate on God's Word, as it is essential for your growth.
   - 1 Peter 2:2: "Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation."
   - Matthew 4:4: "But he answered, 'It is written, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.""

2. PRAYER AND COMMUNION WITH GOD: Prayer is a vital component of your relationship with God. Establish a habit of regular communication with Him, listening and speaking to Him.
   - Proverbs 1:24-31: Read and understand the importance of two-way communication between God and the believer.

3. OBEDIENCE TO THE HOLY SPIRIT: God expects you to live a life that reflects Christ. You cannot do this on your own. Yield to the Holy Spirit and obey His guidance as He helps you grow and transform.
   - Galatians 5:16: "But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh."

CHALLENGE: Start practicing these disciplines for growth early in your Christian life. Embrace the opportunities to study God's Word, engage in prayer, and obey the leading of the Holy Spirit. By doing so, you will continue to grow and mature in your faith.
