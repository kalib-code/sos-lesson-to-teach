# YOU ARE READY TO GROW

Your decision to accept Christ as your Savior resulted in the following:

1. You have become the **CHILD of God** – Romans 8:15,16
2. You are now a **NEW CREATION** – 2 Cor. 5:17
3. You have been born again, so you have a **NEW LIFE** – Eph. 2:1-5

## GROWTH IS THE EVIDENCE OF THE NEW LIFE IN YOU!

Having a new life, you are to establish new patterns of behavior. When a baby is born in the natural world, it will die unless its parents take care of it. It is also true about your spiritual life. If you feed it, you will grow and if you neglect it, it will die. God has already started something in your life, He wants to complete it. **YOUR NEXT STEP IS TO GROW**

1. **GROW IN YOUR NEW LIFE, LIKE A NEWBORN BABY** --Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation (1 Pet 2:2)

2. **Growth should be towards becoming like Christ** -- And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose. For those God foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the likeness of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. Rom 8:28-29

3. **Our Heavenly Father eagerly looks at our development toward maturity**. So, we must be conscious of God’s working to mature us daily – being confident of this, that He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus (Phil 1:6) May God himself, the God of peace, sanctify you through and through. May your whole spirit, soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will do it. (1Thes 5:23-24)

4. **God has provided what a believer needs for growth** - His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness. (2 Pet 1:3).

## PERSONAL DISCIPLINES FOR SPIRITUAL GROWTH

1. **STUDY AND MEDITATION OF GOD’S WORD** - The Bible is our Spiritual food. Growth is in direct proportion to our increasing knowledge of God’s Word. 

   - 1 Pet 2:2: Like newborn babies, crave pure spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow up in your salvation
   - Matt 4:4: Jesus answered, "It is written: 'Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

2. **PRAYER & COMMUNION WITH GOD** - Prayer can be likened to our breathing. So, prayer is a two-way communication. We talk to God; God talks to us. The people who listen to God will have a God that listens to them.

   - Read with convert Pro.1:24-31 to show that there should be two-way communication between God and the believer.

3. **OBEDIENCE TO THE HOLY SPIRIT** - God expects us to live a Christ-like life. But we can’t do this on our own. So, God gave us the Holy Spirit to enable us. We need to yield to the Holy Spirit to be victorious and continually change. Change happens through our obedience to the voice of the Holy Spirit.

   - Gal 5:16 So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature.

## CHALLENGE: Start these disciplines for growth early in your Christian life.
