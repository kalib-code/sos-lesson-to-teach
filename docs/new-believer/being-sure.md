# BEING SURE

As a new believer, it's important to have assurance of your salvation and not be swayed by doubt or the attacks of the enemy. Here are key points to help you be sure of your faith:

## God Cannot Lie
- **ROM 3:4** - Let God be true, and every man a liar.

## Believe God's Testimony
- Accept God's testimony about His Son and believe in Him.
- **I Jn 5:9-13** - God's testimony is greater than man's testimony. Those who believe in the Son of God have the testimony of eternal life in their hearts.

## Three Sources of Assurance
a. God's Word is True
- **Titus 1:2** - God, who cannot lie, promised eternal life before the world began.
- **Heb 6:18** - It is impossible for God to lie. Take hold of the hope offered and be greatly encouraged.

b. Christ is in Your Life Now
- **John 3:36** - Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.
- **John 5:24** - Whoever hears Christ's word and believes in Him has eternal life and will not be condemned.

c. Witness of God's Spirit
- **Rom 8:16** - The Holy Spirit testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.

## Have the Right Foundation
- Base your faith on the facts of God's Word, not on feelings.
- **John 20:31** - The purpose of the written Scriptures is to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by believing, have life in His name.
- **I Jn 5:13** - These things are written so that you may know you have eternal life through faith in the name of the Son of God.

CHALLENGE: Choose to believe God, who cannot lie, over the devil or other people. Verbalize your assurance in prayer, thanking God for the salvation you have received.
