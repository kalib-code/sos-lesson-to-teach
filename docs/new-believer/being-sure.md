# BEING SURE

How can you as a new believer be sure you are really saved? Satanâ€™s immediate weapon
of attack against the new believer is doubt. It is important that you understand what God
says so you will be assured of your experience.
Matt 13:19 "When anyone hears the word of the kingdom, and does not understand it, the
evil {one} comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is the one on whom
seed was sown beside the road.

## God Cannot Lie
- **ROM 3:4** - Let God be true, and every man a liar.

## Believe God's Testimony
Doubting God's testimony is accusing God of lying Believe God's testimony rather than
the devil's or people's words that can cause you to doubt.
I Jn 5:9-13
9 We accept man's testimony, but God's testimony is greater because it is the testimony of
God, which he has given about his Son.
10Anyone who believes in the Son of God has this testimony in his heart. Anyone who does
not believe God has made him out to be a liar, because he has not believed the testimony God
has given about his Son.
11And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
12He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.
13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know
that you have eternal life.

## Three Sources of Assurance
a. God's Word is true, God does not lie 
- Titus 1:2 In hope of eternal life, which God, which cannot lie, promised before the
world began.
-Heb 6:18. it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope offered to us may be greatly encouraged.

b. You have Christ, He is in your life Now

- John 3:36 Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son
will not see life, for God's wrath remains on him."

- John 5:24 "I tell you the truth, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me
has eternal life and will not be condemned; he has crossed over from death to life.

c. The witness of God's Spirit in you
- Rom 8:16 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.

## . HAVE THE RIGHT FOUNDATION FOR YOUR FAITH, DO NOT TRUST IN FEELINGS

Be established in the facts of God's Words.

John 20:31 But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.

I Jn 5:13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.

**CHALLENGE**: Whom will you believe? The devil, other people or God who cannot lie? God
says you are saved. That should settle it. Can you verbalize in prayer of thanksgiving the
assurance you have with regards to your salvation?
