## First Lesson for Bible Studies: To Motivate People to Study the Bible

### Belief Based on God's Word

Being religious, like many Filipinos are, is not enough. A person must evaluate his religious beliefs if these are based on God's word or not. 

Jesus said, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures." (MAT 22:29)x

### IT IS EASY TO SAY 'YES, I BELIEVE IN GOD, BUT
1. Do you know what God wants you to believe, what God promised? What God wants?
    - The "Seven Last Words" of Jesus on the cross is the only word of God some people know.
2. Do you know which religious thing did God command and did not command?
    - Example: Some sincere devotees think they can earn God's favor or salvation if they build chapels for their patron saints. How about those who have no money to do that?

### BIBLICAL ILLUSTRATION OF SUCH CASE: Israel – Read Romans 10:1-3.
1. **GOOD STARTING POINT** - "They are zealous (devoted) to God", v.2
2. **HARMFUL DISADVANTAGE** - "Their zeal is not based on Knowledge" (v.2), "they did not know the righteousness that comes from God" (v.3), meaning - they do not know God's way of putting people right before God (see v.4)
3. **ERRONEOUS CONSEQUENCE** - "they sought to establish their own way" (v.3). They set up their own ways and effort to reach God. This is the essence of all religions.
4. **CONTRARY RESPONSE TO THE GOSPEL** - "they did not submit to God's righteousness" (v.3). When presented with God's way of righteousness which is in Christ Jesus, they will not anymore accept it but rather cling to their erroneous beliefs.
5. **TRAGIC CONDITION** - "they are not saved" (v.1) - not put right with God. (Illustration: a man who took the wrong bus and arrived in a wrong place because he did not read the signboard of the bus).

### THE NEED TO PREACH GOD'S WORD
1. It is the power of God unto salvation. Satan knows this so he takes away God's Word and promotes error instead.
    - Romans 1:16 - I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
    - Luke 8:12 - Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
2. Faith comes only by hearing God's word.
    - Romans 10:17 - …faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.

### GOD WANTS OUR FAITH TO BE BASED ON HIS WORD.
Jesus commanded the Church to preach His Word (MAT 28:19-20) so that people can have a basis for their beliefs and action. Jesus wants people to have their belief based on God's Word. This is true faith as against presumption. **FAITH** is believing and acting based on the evidence of truth. **PRESUMPTION** is believing and acting without or against the evidence of truth.

### CHALLENGE: What do you have? Presumption or faith based on God’s Word?
