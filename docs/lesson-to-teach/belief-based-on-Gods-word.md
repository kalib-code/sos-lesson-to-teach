# BELIEF BASED ON GOD'S WORD

Being religious, like many Filipinos are, is not enough. A person must evaluate their religious beliefs to determine if they are truly based on God's word.

Jesus said, "You are in error because you do not know the Scriptures." (Matthew 22:29)

It is easy to say, "Yes, I believe in God," but it is important to consider the following:

1. Do you know what God wants you to believe and what He has promised? Do you understand His desires? Unfortunately, for some people, the "Seven Last Words" of Jesus on the cross are the only words of God they know.

2. Do you know which religious practices God has commanded and which He has not commanded? For example, some sincere devotees believe they can earn God's favor or salvation by building chapels for their patron saints. But what about those who have no financial means to do so?

Let's look at a biblical illustration of such a case: Israel - Read Romans 10:1-3.

1. GOOD STARTING POINT - "They are zealous (devoted) to God." (Verse 2)

2. HARMFUL DISADVANTAGE - "Their zeal is not based on knowledge" (Verse 2), "they did not know the righteousness that comes from God" (Verse 3). This means they lack understanding of God's way of reconciling people to Himself.

3. ERRONEOUS CONSEQUENCE - "They sought to establish their own way" (Verse 3). They created their own methods and efforts to reach God. This is the essence of all religions that rely on human works for salvation.

4. CONTRARY RESPONSE TO THE GOSPEL - "They did not submit to God's righteousness" (Verse 3). When presented with God's way of righteousness, which is through Christ Jesus, they refuse to accept it and cling to their erroneous beliefs.

5. TRAGIC CONDITION - "They are not saved" (Verse 1) - they are not made right with God. (Illustration: A man who took the wrong bus and arrived in the wrong place because he did not read the bus signboard.)

THE NEED TO PREACH GOD'S WORD

1. The gospel is the power of God unto salvation. Satan knows this, so he attempts to take away God's Word and promote error instead.

Romans 1:16 - "I am not ashamed of the gospel because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile."

Luke 8:12 - "Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved."

2. Faith comes through hearing God's word. Romans 10:17 states that faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.

GOD WANTS OUR FAITH TO BE BASED ON HIS WORD.

Jesus commanded the Church to preach His Word (Matthew 28:19-20) so that people can have a foundation for their beliefs and actions. Jesus desires that people have their faith rooted in God's Word. This represents true faith, supported by evidence and truth. In contrast, presumption is believing and acting without or against the evidence of truth.

CHALLENGE: What do you have? Presumption or faith based on God's Word?
