# GROWING WITH OTHER BELIEVERS

When we become children of God through faith and repentance, we enter into a journey of spiritual growth, which involves our relationship with other believers in the church.

## BASIC TRUTHS ABOUT THE CHURCH

### Origin of the Church
- Jesus is the builder - Matt. 16:18
- He died for it and purchased it - 1 Peter 1:18-19
- Christ is the cornerstone (Eph 2:20) and the Head (Eph 4:15)
- Summary: The church is a divine idea, originating from God.

### Meaning of the Word Church
- The Greek word "ekklesia" means "the called out and called unto." In the New Testament, it refers to people who are called out from sin and called unto God.
- The English word "church" is derived from a root word that means "that which belongs to God."

### The Church Concept: A Body, People - Not a Place or Building
- All who accept the message of Christ are added to the body of believers, not an organization or physical structure.
- The church is like a body with many parts, each functioning and relating to one another.
- Acts 2:41 - Those who accepted the message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
- Acts 5:14 - More and more people believed in the Lord and were added to their number.

## THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH MODEL

The biblical church life involves believers gathering in two ways:

1. In Small Groups
2. As a Congregation in Corporate Celebration Gathering

- Acts 2:46 - Believers continued to meet together daily, breaking bread in their homes and sharing meals with glad and sincere hearts.
- Acts 5:42 - They taught and proclaimed the good news in the temple courts and from house to house.
- Acts 20:20 - Public teaching and house-to-house instruction were both part of the church's life.
