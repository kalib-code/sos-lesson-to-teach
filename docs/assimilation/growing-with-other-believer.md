# GROWING WITH OTHER BELIEVERS

There are aspects of spiritual growth that a Christian experiences with other believers. When one becomes a child of God through faith and repentance, God adds him to the church.

## BASIC TRUTHS ABOUT THE CHURCH

### ORIGIN OF THE CHURCH
a. Jesus is the builder - Matt. 16:18  
b. He died for it, and bought it - 1 Peter 1:18,19  
c. Christ is the cornerstone (Eph 2:20) and the Head (EPH 4:15)  
   *Summary: The church is a divine idea; its origin is God!*

### MEANING OF THE WORD CHURCH
a. Greek word `ekklesia` - means “the called out and called unto.” In the NT it refers to people who are **called out from sin and called unto God**.  
b. English word derived from root word w/c means `that which belongs to God`.

### THE CHURCH CONCEPT: A BODY, PEOPLE - NOT A PLACE, NOT A BUILDING
The verses below tell us that all who accepted the message were added to the body of believers - not to an organization nor to a building.

A body with many parts, each part functional, and all parts relating to one another.

- **Acts 2:41** Those who accepted his message were baptized, and about three thousand were added to their number that day.
- **Acts 5:14** Nevertheless, more and more men and women believed in the Lord and were added to their number.

The church as a body means the church is people in relationship to God and to one another.

- **Eph 4:15-16** … we will in all things grow up into him who is the Head, that is, Christ. From him the whole body, joined and held together by every supporting ligament, grows, and builds itself up in love, as each part does its work.

## THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH MODEL
The Biblical church life involves the gathering of the believers in two manners:

1. **IN SMALL GROUPS**
2. **AS A CONGREGATION IN CORPORATE CELEBRATION GATHERING**
   - **Acts 2:46** Every day they continued to meet together in the temple courts. They broke bread in their homes and ate together with glad and sincere hearts,
   - **Acts 5:42** Day after day, in the temple courts and from house to house, they never stopped teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus is the Christ.
   - **Acts 20:20** You know that I have not hesitated to preach anything that would be helpful to you but have taught you publicly and from house to house.
